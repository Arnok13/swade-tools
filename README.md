# SWADE Tools (BETA)
A Foundry VTT module for use with Savage Worlds (SWADE system);
A series of automations for swade: Joker's Wild (with bonus); Status Management (with icons); Reroll with a benny; detect targets, hit and damage; etc. 

**ATTENTION: This is a BETA version so bugs may occur.**
This is my first big module, please report if you see any bugs and be nice :)

## Features

1. Automatically rolls initiative when combat starts 
2. Distribute bennies automatically when a Joker is drawn (Joker's Wild)
3. Add +2 Bonus when a character has a Joker
4. Show icons on the tokens for the status, wounds and fatigue. And link status that apply another: Stunned also marks Distracted and Vulnerable
5. Manage Status automatically during the combat. Rolls to remove Stunned and Shaken (offer a to use a benny if it fails), removes Distracted and Vulnerable at the end of turn. Shows a warn for Entagled and Bound
6. Shows a button to Reroll with a Benny in every roll. And shows a critical failure message (hiding the benny button in this case)
7. Weapons and Powers show a dialog box instead of sending to chat directly. They also count shots and power points automatically (can be disabled in module settings)
8. Weapons and Powers auto-detect when targets are selected, showing hit, raise with a button to roll damage and apply wounds.
9. Translation support (English and Portuguese BR available)

### Bonus: Macro
A Macro that shows the "Quick Access" of the selected token and rolls the basic skill with a checkbox to show more options (in dialog). Only works with the module.

## Settings
Most of the module will be enabled by default, so if you want to disable something, post an issue. I'm planning on adding more options in the settings.
